# 🚨 CONFLICT PREVENTION GUIDE

# ================================

## 📋 What We Did:

1. Created a separate branch: `fix/vite-charts-compatibility`
2. Isolated package changes from other changes
3. Included backup files and recovery script
4. Used detailed commit messages

## 🔄 For Your Team Members:

### Before Pulling Changes:

```bash
# 1. Check current status
git status

# 2. Stash any local changes
git stash

# 3. Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# 4. If you want to use the fixed versions:
git checkout fix/vite-charts-compatibility
npm install

# 5. If you want to keep original versions:
git checkout main
# (Your original versions remain unchanged)
```

### If Package Conflicts Occur:

```bash
# Use our recovery script
./frontend/RECOVERY_SCRIPT.bat

# Or manually restore
cp frontend/package.json.backup frontend/package.json
cp frontend/package-lock.json.backup frontend/package-lock.json
npm install
```

## 🎯 Merge Strategy Options:

### Option 1: Merge to Main (Recommended after testing)

```bash
git checkout main
git merge fix/vite-charts-compatibility
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Keep as Feature Branch (Safest)

```bash
# Keep branch separate until everyone tests
# Each developer can choose which version to use
git checkout fix/vite-charts-compatibility  # Use fixed versions
git checkout main                           # Use original versions
```

### Option 3: Cherry-pick Only Component Changes

```bash
git checkout main
git cherry-pick b1687ce  # Only the component improvements
# Skip the package changes if they cause conflicts
```

## 🛡️ Conflict Resolution:

### For package.json conflicts:

1. Keep the working version (either original or fixed)
2. Don't merge conflicting package.json files
3. Let each developer choose their preferred setup

### For component files:

1. These should merge cleanly
2. If conflicts occur, they're usually minor styling changes
3. Can be resolved normally through standard git merge

## 📞 Emergency Recovery:

If anything goes wrong:

1. Run `./frontend/RECOVERY_SCRIPT.bat`
2. Or restore from backup files
3. Or checkout main branch and start fresh

## ✅ Testing Checklist:

- [ ] Charts render properly
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] All components load correctly
- [ ] Build process works (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Development server starts (`npm run dev`)

## 🎯 Recommendation:

Keep this as a feature branch until submission is complete.
After successful submission, decide as a team whether to merge to main.
