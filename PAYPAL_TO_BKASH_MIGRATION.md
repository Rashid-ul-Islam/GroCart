### Visual Branding:
- **Before**: Blue background with "P" icon
- **After**: Pink background with "bK" icon (bKash brand colors)

### Comments and Labels:

- **After**: "bKash Option"

## Testing Checklist:

- [ ] Payment method selection shows "bKash" option

- Order management functionality is unaffected

## Impact:
- Users now see consistent "bKash" branding throughout the app
- Payment method value correctly reflects the actual payment service
- Pink color scheme matches bKash brand identity
- All conditional logic now properly references "bkash"
