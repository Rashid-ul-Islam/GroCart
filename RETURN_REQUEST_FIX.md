# Return Request Admin Tracking Implementation

## Update: Proper Admin ID Implementation

### The Problem

Initially, the return request system was failing because we were hardcoding `admin_id = 1` without ensuring that user ID existed in the database. The foreign key constraint `ReturnRequest_processed_by_fkey` was preventing updates when the referenced admin user didn't exist.

### The Solution

**Proper Authentication Integration**: Now using the actual logged-in admin's user ID from the AuthContext.

### Changes Made:

#### Frontend (`ReturnRequests.jsx`):

1. **Import AuthContext**:

   - Added `import { useAuth } from "../context/AuthContext";`
   - Added `const { user } = useAuth();` to get current logged-in user

2. **Approve Request**:

   - Added `admin_id: user?.user_id` to the request body
   - Now passes the actual logged-in admin's user ID

3. **Reject Request**:
   - Added `admin_id: user?.user_id` to the request body
   - Now passes the actual logged-in admin's user ID

#### Backend (`adminReturnController.js`):

1. **Admin ID Validation**:

   - Added `admin_id` parameter validation in both approve and reject functions
   - Added database check to verify the admin_id exists in the User table
   - Returns proper error if admin_id is invalid

2. **Approve Function**:

   - Restored `processed_by = $2` in the UPDATE query
   - Added admin_id validation and database existence check
   - Now properly tracks which admin approved each request

3. **Reject Function**:

   - Restored `processed_by = $2` in the UPDATE query
   - Added admin_id validation and database existence check
   - Now properly tracks which admin rejected each request

4. **Get All Requests**:
   - Added LEFT JOIN to get admin username who processed each request
   - Added `processed_by_admin` field to the response
   - Shows which admin processed each return request

### Current Behavior

- Return requests can be approved/rejected successfully
- The `processed_by` field now properly stores the admin's user ID
- Admin tracking is fully functional with proper validation
- The system shows which admin processed each request
- All database constraints are satisfied

### Security Benefits

- Uses actual authenticated admin user ID instead of hardcoded values
- Validates admin existence before processing requests
- Provides proper audit trail of admin actions
- Prevents unauthorized request processing

## Files Modified

- `backend/controllers/adminReturnController.js`
- `frontend/src/pages/ReturnRequests.jsx`

The system now properly tracks admin actions while maintaining all core return request functionality with proper authentication integration.
