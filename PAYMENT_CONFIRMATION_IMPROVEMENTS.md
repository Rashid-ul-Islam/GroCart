## Technical Details

### Key Code Changes:

#### State Management:
```javascript
const [paymentStatus, setPaymentStatus] = useState('pending'); 
// Now supports: pending, completed, failed, creating_order
```

#### Enhanced Status Icons:
```javascript
case 'creating_order':
  return (
    <motion.div animate={{ rotate: 360 }} ...>
      <Package className="w-16 h-16" />
    </motion.div>
  );
```

#### Progressive Feedback:
```javascript
{paymentStatus === 'creating_order' && (
  <motion.div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-green-50 to-blue-50">
    // Step-by-step progress with animations
  </motion.div>
)}
```
